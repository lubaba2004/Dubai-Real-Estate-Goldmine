# 🏙️ Dubai Real Estate Goldmine  
### UAE Rental Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting **rental property prices across the United Arab Emirates (UAE)** using machine learning techniques.  
The dataset includes listings from major cities such as **Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman, Ras Al Khaimah, Umm Al Quwain, and Al Ain**, sourced from real estate platforms.

The goal of this project is to:
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Build and compare multiple **regression models**
- Select the **best-performing model**
- Predict rental prices based on property features

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Accurately estimating rental prices is crucial for:
- Real estate investors  
- Property owners  
- Tenants  
- Market analysts  

This project aims to **predict rental prices** using historical property data and machine learning algorithms.
